# Celebrity-Search-Application
This repository contains a Streamlit web application that leverages OpenAI's API and the LangChain library to provide detailed information about celebrities. The application uses a series of chained prompts to gather and display information such as the celebrity's biography, birth date, and major world events around the time of their birth.
